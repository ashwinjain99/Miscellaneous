## Project Outline

Air pollution is the fourth leading risk factor for early death and the leading environmental cause of death worldwide, contributing to over 7 million (1 out of 8) deaths, as estimated by the World Health Organization. Up to 99% of us are breathing polluted air, cutting lives short by an average of 2.2 years across the globe.

The idea behind this project is to analyze real-time data of air quality across all the states in the United States and determine the best and worst states with regard to air quality.
We hope to further analyze the air quality in the abovementioned states to uncover any patterns with seasonal changes and draw some insightful conclusions.

## Research Questions
1. What are the states with the best and worst AQI in the US?
2. What concentration of pm10 and pm25 persist in these states and how they vary seasonally.
3. Are there any significant factors contributing to AQI in these states.
4. If and what can be done to help improve air quality index.
